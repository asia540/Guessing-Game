**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Asia Collins**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/gabby-road-kicker?path=README.md%3A7%3A15)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I feel that i could add more sound effects to the game. I could possibly have added a sound to the end of the 
game depending on the result of a win or loss.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Google Color Picker, CSS Web Safe Fonts]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I faced was figuring out why my game was not working correctly. My game was not continuing after the third correct guess.
In order to figure out what the issue was, I began to debug my code to find what mistake I could have made. I knew that the problem
would involve one of the buttons so I checked the button functions along with the CSS button rules. I found that I did not put a comma in the button 4 rule before the #button4.lit. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I want to know more about JavaScript because I believe that it would be very interesting working with adding interactive behaviors to webpages.
I feel that I want to improve on all of the other languages in order to become the best that I can be at developing webpages in the future. I'd also like to know more features that JavaScript
has to offer so that I can become knowledgable of how I can make a webpage more interactive for the users. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours, I would spend more time working with adding more sound features to the buttons. I would like to change experiment with the possible designs for each of the buttons. Also,
it would be great to be able to add different scenes to the game where the after the player wins or loses, a different screen shows up to alert them if they won or lost the game. I would add an intro screen for the player
at the beginning of the game as well as an outro screen when the game ends to tell them their best score so far.
